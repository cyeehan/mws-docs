## Another fun ride for the month! ðŸš€

Another fun ride for the month! The squad has successfully achieved plenty of milestones ranging from internal bonding to external collaboration with other entities. Hence, I wish you a good time rehashing those beautiful moments from reading the newsletter. Stay safe and see you soon!

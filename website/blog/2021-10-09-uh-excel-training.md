On 22nd September 2021 from 2pm to 4pm, Modern Workplace Squad organized a UH Excel Digital Workshop. This was a training session held for students under INTIâ€™s University of Hertfordshire Programme Students. It covers beginner and intermediate Microsoft Excel Skills.

Opening the session, our Subang Vice Leader, Jenn Fu guided students on steps to install Microsoft Office 365 for free using their INTI student email. 

The training session began with the beginner level. Our first trainer, Deyeera Ponambalam carefully explained basics of Excel such as how to insert rows, columns, wrap text, merge cells, center and use simple mathematics functions for calculations. She taught the students step by step on how to use each tool properly.

Then, our second trainer, me, Ting Ai Leng continued with the next level of training. I showed students the table, charts, freeze panes, flash fill, V and H Lookup functions. It was nerve wrecking being a trainer for the first time ðŸ˜…. Yet, it is satisfying to be a part of this training and grow beyond my comfort zone.  

Finally, our third trainer, Stephanie Chong covered intermediate Excel formulas like IF and PMT. She carefully explained differences between the IRR, NPV and XIRR, XNPV formulas. Finishing off the trainings, Stephanie demonstrated how to use Goal Seek in finding the estimated variable for the desired result value.  

A total of 58 students joined this workshop. Our trainers patiently guided the students in using all these features to ensure everyone can understand.  

Other than our trainers, we have Jenn Fu, Chong Fui May and Krishna Priya as our 3 helpful facilitators for this workshop. Without them, this workshop would not have been a success.  

All facilitators and trainers did amazing!  

As one the trainers, I am glad to work in such a great team of people who inspires one another. It has been a wonderful experience in this journey of completing the workshop together for the students.  

We look forward to more exciting trainings from the squad! Until then ðŸ™‚
